# Module Status Analysis

This document provides an analysis of each module in the project based on structure mapping, workflow checks, and quality checks.

## Status Legend

- **OK**: Module is well-structured, functional, and meets quality standards
- **À revoir**: Module needs review or refactoring (e.g., cleanup, consolidation)
- **A faire**: Module requires significant work or implementation

## Module Status Table

| Module | Status | Analysis |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Core Application (src/App.tsx, src/main.tsx, src/index.css) | OK | Well-structured entry points, application runs successfully in development and preview modes |
| Components (src/components/) | OK | Comprehensive component library with proper organization, UI components, and business logic components |
| Pages (src/pages/) | OK | All main application pages implemented with proper routing and functionality |
| Data (src/data/) | À revoir | Multiple similar data files (e.g., lessonsData variants), needs consolidation and cleanup |
| Hooks (src/hooks/) | OK | Custom hooks for state management, cloud sync, and offline storage properly implemented |
| Contexts (src/contexts/) | OK | Language context properly set up for internationalization |
| Services (src/services/) | OK | Dictionary and favorites services with Firebase integration working correctly |
| Library/Utilities (src/lib/) | OK | Utility functions and Firebase configuration properly organized |
| Styles (src/styles/) | OK | Global styles, responsive design, and theme support implemented |
| Types (src/types/) | À revoir | Multiple type definition files with some duplication, needs consolidation |
| Scripts (scripts/) | OK | Data extraction and processing scripts for lessons, grammar, and PDFs |
| Server (server/) | OK | Backend server with dictionary data and study requests handling |
| Public Assets (public/) | OK | Static assets, images, and service worker properly configured |
| Assets (assets/) | OK | Application icons and assets for different platforms |

| Tests (tests/) | OK | Playwright test suite for end-to-end testing |
| Configuration (root config files) | OK | Vite, ESLint, TypeScript, and other config files properly set up |
